# History behind these files
In my down time while waiting for my work permit, when taking breaks from studying, I'd sometimes watch Development Livestreams on Twitch.tv.

One day I made a friend in the RPG Maker community, and found out they have few Plugin Developers. Most of the RPG Maker developers don't actually know Javascript, so they have to resort to other people.

A few of the developers in the group I bonded with said they'd asked plenty of times and the RPG Maker community was convinced making a Timer using a Web Time as opposed to the local computer time was impossible. I downloaded the 20 day Trial and made the plugin for them.

Since then they've sometimes asked for a few things and I've been happy to help.
